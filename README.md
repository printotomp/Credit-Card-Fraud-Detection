Credit Card Fraud Detection in Financial Systems

This MSc Data Science project investigates fraud detection using multiple machine learning models, with a strong emphasis on ethical AI, fairness, and transparency. Built using Python, Scikit-learn, Keras, and custom SVM logic, it demonstrates how technical rigor can align with social responsibility.

 🔍 Models Implemented

- Logistic Regression: Baseline model with ROC and confusion matrix
- Random Forest: Feature importance, precision/recall, and tree visualization
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN): Keras-based model with SMOTETomek balancing
- Support Vector Machine (SVM): Custom hinge loss and gradient optimization

 📊 Key Metrics

- Accuracy: Up to 92%
- Precision: 89%
- F1-Score: 90%
- MCC and ROC curves
- SHAP-style interpretability (suggested)

 🧠 Ethical Framing

- Balanced sampling using SMOTETomek
- Transparent decision-making via visualizations
- Audit-ready metrics and fairness-aware evaluation
- Custom SVM logic for deeper algorithmic control
